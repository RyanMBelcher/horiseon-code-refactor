# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

I have refactored this web app in order to make it more accessible. Web accessibility is vitally important as in ensures that all users of the site have a decent user experience and are able to access the information you have provided on your page. This includes (but is not limited to) updating the code to contain semantic html elements  and adding alt elements to the images.

## Credits

Shoutouts to:

 my wife, Dominique Clarke, who was very helpful as I asked her tons of questions and complained to whenever things did not seem to work as I wanted it to

 Leif Hetland for answering my questions in office hours regaring how to alt tag some of the images on the page

 accesibility.gov and w3.org both provided me with a better understanding on the importance of accessibilty on webpages
